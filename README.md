Asynchronous Python 3.6 API of United Wardrobe (https://unitedwardrobe.com)

## Why?
I just felt like it...

## How?
Android + Xposed + SSLUnpinning + Debug Proxy Premium

## Feedback to the developers of this app
When reverse engineering the API I noticed a few things such as:
..+ Double User-Agent header when  making requests...
..+ Always sends your own user_id, I don't know why you guys send the user_id if it doesn't matter what value it is (message/comment spoofing is impossible, so why send the user_id)

## Usage
See the main.py in this repository, it works just fine
What you do with your code is your business, not mine.
